<p>After failing to come to terms on a contract extension with the Red Wings, Coach Mike Babcock requested and received permission to seek employment elsewhere on May 8, 2015. The Buffalo Sabres were considered the most serious contenders for Babcock's services. However, on May 20, 2015, it was announced that Babcock would become the new head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He reportedly received an eight year deal worth $50 million ($6.25 million per season average), and will be the highest paid coach in NHL history. Prior to Babcock inking the deal, Todd McLellan of the Edmonton Oilers was the highest paid coach in the league, reportedly earning $3 million per season.</p>

In 2008 he was named head coach and general manager of the Indiana Ice, a Tier 1 junior hockey team in the United States Hockey League. In Blashill's first season, the Ice won the Clark Cup for the USHL Championship.

Blashill was named head coach of the Western Michigan Broncos men's ice hockey team on April 6, 2010.

In July 2011, after only one season at Western Michigan, Blashill accepted an assistant coach position for the NHL's Detroit Red Wings under head coach Mike Babcock.

<p><i>Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, from left Canada Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Murray Howe, Gordie Howe's son announced that the future publicly owned bridge between Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, Mich, would be named Gordie Howe International Bridge.</i></p>
<p><strong>Canada Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Gov. Rick Snyder met along the Windsor riverfront to announce the name of the planned new crossing as the Gordie Howe International Bridge. The qualities that made Gordie Howe "Mr. Hockey" are the same leaders from the U.S. and Canada want in their new Detroit-Windsor bridge: strength, endurance, excellence.</p>
<p>The choice in many ways seemed obvious, widely promoted by fans in advance, although disliked by some for naming a bridge after a sports figure.</p><strong></p>
